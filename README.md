# Facial Recognition Attendance System
Project for Software Engineering CSC 0313.

Detect and recognize a student's face using Python and OpenCV. After recognizing the student, it logs the time and places it into an excel file.

- `Facial Detection` - The ability of the program to 'detect' faces.

- `Facial Recognition` - The ability of the program to 'identify' whose faces are shown.

## Installation
### Requirements
- Python 3.3+

## Goals
- [ ] Facial Detection & Recognition System
- [ ] Train AI to be accurate? (not sure if modules are allowed)
- [ ] Publish time, date and name of student on to an excel file 

### Additionals
- Add delay for 30 minutes every recognized students
- How accurate is the system
-  UI for the facial recognition and menu 
-  Student Attendance Statistics
   - Records a class' number of present, lates and absent

## Notes
- Tilted Head
- Low Brightness
- With Face Mask
