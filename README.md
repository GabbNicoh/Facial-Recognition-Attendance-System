# Facial Recognition Attendance System
Project for Software Engineering CSC 0313.

Detect and recognize a student's face using Python and OpenCV. After recognizing the student, it logs the time and places it into an excel file.

- `Facial Detection` - The ability of the program to 'detect' faces.

- `Facial Recognition` - The ability of the program to 'identify' whose faces are shown.
